# Text-Generation-Using-RNN
Story generation system using RNN LM, Bigram LM, and HMM LM

In the initial pahse, 2 datasets were genertaed by collecting Shakespeare's story Othello and Macbeth.
Moreover, to generate a different style of story "Harry Potter and Philosopher's stone" story was collected to form a different dataset.
Data preprocessing steps were carried out to clean the raw input data.

Finally, three langguage models were implemented to generate different style stories.
